# Autocomplete search plugin
This is an <input> field plugin that adds the capability to return results from a JSON file/URL or server side search JSON response page

The datasource of the plugin can be a JSON file (like the included sample.json), an online JSON file URL (like the applied in the demo.html), or a page URL where you can 

The results are displayed in an unordered list (ul) with the ability to use the up/down keyboard keys to move between the returned results

Each result is displayed in an anchor link (a) with a "data-value" attribute containing the value of the result, the result is clickable and the function name that is called can be defined in the plugin options
